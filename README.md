# SaunaBooker

This is a demo application made with Python and Flask, hosted in AWS. The application's database is AWS DynamoDB and the hosting the AWS Lightsail-service runs the app in a Docker container. You can test the application [here](https://sauna-service.8d83590l223hm.eu-north-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/login). I will keep the app hosted at least until the end of January 2024.
